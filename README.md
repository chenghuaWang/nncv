NNCV
---
Neural Networks Inference Computing Framework for Computer Vision(NNCV) is a High-Performance and Light-Weighted lib with minimum third party libs dependency. NNCV now focus on cuda device and cpu(x86) inferring. Different from other inference computing frameworks, NNCV will optimize the compute graph automatically(branch cutting and op fusion, etc).

*Features:*

1. A tool for converting ONNX to NNCV's representation.
2. Automatically optimize compute graph:
    * Op fusion
    * Branch cutting
    * etc
3. Highly optimized operation kernel.
4. Carefully and efficient memory management.
5. A Perf tool for testing your networks performance.

*Supporting:*
