Neural Networks Inference&Compiling Framework for Computer Vision(NNCV). This is a personal practice project for MLSys. 

## Todo

1. **lowering loop op to scf.while op**
    The condition region of loop op will be automatically eliminated by mlir. So transforms can't work.

2. **Add a new `for` grammer called `pfor` which take arguments {startValue; endValue; step}**
    When adding new grammer, solving some already known bugs.
